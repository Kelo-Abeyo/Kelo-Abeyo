    computer science is the study of algorithmic processes, computational machines and computation it self as
    well as a discipline, computer science span a range of topics from theoretical studies of the algorithims computation
    and  information to the practical issues of implementing computational system in hardware and software. computer
    and computing as well as their theoretical and practical application computer science applies the principles
    of the mathematics, enginering and logic to a pleth  of functions including algorithims formulation, software
    and hardware developent and artificial intelligence.
    defines computer science as "a discipline that involves the. understanding and design of
    computers and computational. processes." However, this definition is also very broad. and
    would allow many extraneous cases to fall within the. 
    umbrella of computer science.
