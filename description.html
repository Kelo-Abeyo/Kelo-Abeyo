    computer science is about understanding the depth of a computer system, we care about how a computer system
    realy work we use our understanding, skill and knoweledge to creat programs to solve real problems 
    computer science requires an understanding of the fundamental concept of the computational thinking as well
     as well as knoweledge of how computer and other degital devices operate.
     computer science is the study of computer and algorithmic processes, including their principles, their 
     hardware and software designs, their applications and their impact on social.
     computer science. The study of information, protocols and algorithms for idealized and real automata.
     automaton: “self-moving” – in our context, self “deciding” or autonomous mechanism with bounded
     resources (time and space) • information: knowledge represented 
     in a form suitable for transmission, manipulation, etc.
     protocol: rules for exchanging information without problems

    <h2>computer science</h2>
    <ol>
       <li>a theory and practical that allows yuo to programing a computer
         to do what you want it to
       </li>
       <li>a tool that helps you tell a story or make something happen with technology</li>
       <li>a discipline that emphasize persistence in problem solving a skill that is applicable 
         a cross disciplines, driving job groeth and innovation acros all sectors of the work force
       </li>
       <li>a skill that teaches student how to use computer to creat, not just consume</li>
